WOOHOO ITS FINALLY WORKING

I was gonna make this more complex but
I was honestly tired of this shit so
all you get is "what".

On a real note, this is a big step for
me and I am very proud of myself, even
though this is, to some, a simple ass
program.

I've never hand-coded an assembly
program before, so this is really nice
to say I have done.

Keep in mind, I am only 15 at the moment,
and typically code in Java, C#, or Python,
so this code might not look all that great
to an average Assembly programmer. If you
do have any ideas on how to either make this
cleaner or just ways I can improve (if i end
up continuing coding assembly), please email
me: johnfioregames@gmail.com.

The end
